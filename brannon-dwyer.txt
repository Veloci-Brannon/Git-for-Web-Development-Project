Hello its kinda taken me a while to figure this out. I was met with a slight wall to climb over when running git bash commands in visual studio code.
I created this file in git bash. When I tried opening it from git bash it opened in my computers notepad editor from what ive read so far, well actually I dont think ive read enough cause im still not sure how to open the file in Visual Studio code from the git bash terminal. But Im on my way to figuring this out.
